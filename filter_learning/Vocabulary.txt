Homodyne detection:
It is a method of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase and/or frequency of an oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be identical to the signal if it carried null information. Homodyne detection is more readily applicable to velocity sensing.

Radar cross-section (RCS):
It is a measure of how detectable an object is with a radar. A larger RCS indicates that an object is more easily detected.
An object reflects a limited amount of radar energy back to the source. The factors that influence this include:
the material of which the target is made;
the absolute size of the target;
the relative size of the target (in relation to the wavelength of the illuminating radar);
the incident angle (angle at which the radar beam hits a particular portion of target which depends upon shape of target and its orientation to the radar source);
the reflected angle (angle at which the reflected beam leaves the part of the target hit, it depends upon incident angle);
the polarization of transmitted and the received radiation in respect to the orientation of the target
